#Elf Invaders
I wanted to mess around with p5.js some, so I wrote this Space Invaders clone with a holiday twist.  It is just a prototype/demo and is not finished.

## TODO:
- Wave screen
- Title screen
- Game Over screen (Santa must die!)
- High score

## Ideas:
- Generalize code to build game engine on top of p5.js (or just use one of the many already avaiable :smile:)
  - Go towards some sort of entity model ala Unity
- Add something similar to the Space Invaders space ship that gives bonus points
